 Issue 1: How about we consider a hybrid option and pre-buffer playback by an adjustable amount to give audio time to process before it is played, or am I missing the neuance of how blooper5 was supposed to work? 

 Issue 2: As far as I can remember, blooper4 had a valid layout for vertical lines with regard to zooming. The theory was that each measure was broken up by beats (4 1/4 note beats per measure as a standard, but this will need to be changable over the coarse of a song for different time signature changes) these beats were subdivided by 2 triplet lines. if zoomed in, these triplet lines dissapear and beats are cut in half (IE 8 x 1/8 notes) and these new, shorter beat units were subdivided by 2 triplet line. this pattern continued as you zoomed in for 1/6th notes, 32nd notes, 64th notes, and 128th notes.zooming out past 4 1/4 notes per measure should initially make triplet lines dissapear, and eventually make beat lines dissapear leaving only measures. that should be the furthest out zoom option with 1/4 note and triplet lines bening the default zoom level.
